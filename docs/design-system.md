# ShelfPick Design System

## Brand

Primary: Forest Green. Accent: Warm Gold.

The approved logo is Shelf + Meeple: three vertical board-game boxes, a meeple
bookend and a shared shelf. Game covers should remain visually dominant.

### Brand assets

- Use `shelfpick-logo-light.svg` on light authentication, onboarding and larger
  brand surfaces. Use `shelfpick-logo-dark.svg` on the matching dark surfaces.
- Use `shelfpick-mark.svg` for compact brand contexts; the favicon and install
  icons use the same mark without wordmark text.
- Light artwork uses Forest Green `#315C48` and Warm Gold `#C28B37`. Dark artwork
  uses the existing dark brand-token values `#70A889` and `#E3AD55`.
- Keep the standalone mark at least 16px high. Use the 180px, 192px and 512px
  raster exports for platform metadata rather than scaling the wordmark.
- Preserve aspect ratio, clear space and supplied colours. Do not recolour,
  stretch, rotate, outline or decorate the logo.
- The full logo names the product and should not sit beside duplicate visible
  `ShelfPick` text. Decorative duplicates must be hidden from assistive technology.

## Core rules

- Never hard-code UI colours in page or component CSS when a semantic token exists.
- New UI must support light and dark mode.
- Use semantic CSS tokens.
- Green represents primary actions and active states.
- Gold is an accent and should be used sparingly.
- Do not use gold as a warning colour.
- Game artwork should remain visually dominant.
- Prefer existing shared UI components over page-specific versions.
- New colours must first be added as semantic tokens with a documented purpose.
- New frontend visual work should read this document before implementation.

## Tokens and theme mechanism

`frontend/src/styles/tokens.css` is the single palette source, imported by
`App.css`. Light values live on `:root`; dark values live on
`:root[data-theme="dark"]`. Native form controls use the matching `color-scheme`.
The small blocking `public/theme.js` script sets the root attribute from the OS
preference before React paints and follows subsequent OS changes. No theme
control or storage preference is introduced. Hosts/previews can set an explicit
`data-theme="light"` or `data-theme="dark"` on the initial HTML to opt out of OS
tracking. Without JavaScript the root palette is light.

| Semantic token (`--color-` prefix) | Light | Dark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brand-primary | #315C48 | #70A889 |
| brand-primary-hover | #284D3C | #86B99C |
| brand-primary-soft | #E3EBE6 | #26382E |
| brand-accent | #C28B37 | #E3AD55 |
| brand-accent-hover | #A9752D | #EDBC6E |
| brand-accent-soft | #F4EAD7 | #403522 |
| bg | #F6F3EB | #151816 |
| surface | #FFFFFF | #202521 |
| surface-raised | #EEEAE0 | #29302B |
| text-primary | #1E2A24 | #F4F1E8 |
| text-secondary | #667068 | #AAB4AD |
| text-inverse | #FFFFFF | #151816 |
| border | #D9D5CB | #39413B |
| success | #3F7655 | #68A77C |
| warning | #A66D16 | #DDB15B |
| danger | #B7463C | #DF746A |
| info | #356A7A | #6FA1AF |

Additional semantic tokens:

- `--color-text-support`: 90% secondary plus 10% primary for supporting text on
  all neutral surfaces. The supplied light secondary/raised pair is only 4.28:1;
  this derived tone clears 4.5:1 while retaining the original palette token.
  Legacy secondary/muted text aliases use this accessible supporting tone.

- `--color-accent-text`: darker gold in light mode for readable small text on
  neutral surfaces; the brand accent itself is unsuitable for small light-theme text.
- `--color-on-accent`: consistently dark text on gold fills in both themes.
- `--color-on-danger`, `--color-danger-hover`: destructive action text and hover.
- `--color-success-soft`, `--color-warning-soft`, `--color-danger-soft`,
  `--color-info-soft`: functional tints mixed with the current surface.
- `--color-overlay`: translucent black scrim, independent of the surface palette.
- `--color-shadow` and `--shadow-card`: theme-aware subtle elevation.

The existing `--sp-*`, `--shelfpick-*`, `--text-primary/secondary/muted/accent`,
`--felt`, `--card`, `--ink`, `--gold`, `--rust` and related aliases resolve to these
tokens centrally. They are compatibility names, not separate palettes. Use
`--color-*` for new work. In particular, `--card` means a surface, not heading text.

Spacing: `--space-1` through `--space-6` = 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32px.
Radii: `--radius-sm/md/lg` = 8, 12, 16px. Existing bespoke geometry is retained
where changing it would redesign the current layout. Typography and minimum
target-size tokens retain their existing names.

## Shared UI and states

Keep existing shared buttons, `SegmentedControl`, `FilterTabs`, `Disclosure`,
`ActionRow`, `PasswordField`, `RetryNotice` and `LoadingMessage`.

- Primary: primary fill, inverse text, primary-hover fill.
- Secondary: transparent/surface fill, primary text and border.
- Accent: accent fill, on-accent text, accent-hover fill; reserve for emphasis.
- Destructive: danger fill plus on-danger text, or danger text on a soft tint.
- Selected controls/navigation: primary text and primary-soft fill or primary indicator.
- Disabled: secondary text on a raised surface; preserve existing disabled interaction.
- Forms: theme-aware surfaces, borders and focus rings; danger for invalid fields.
- Cards/dialogs: surface or surface-raised; scrims use overlay rather than a surface.

Functional colours remain distinct from brand colours. Do not use status colours
as decorative chart/rank colours. Existing product logic, component structure,
routes, responsive geometry and cover rendering are unchanged by this slice.

## Branding, browser chrome and PWA

See `frontend/public/branding/README.md` for the active drop-in asset slots and
future logo exports. Current artwork is intentionally preserved. The manifest
uses Forest Green (`#315C48`) and the cream startup background (`#F6F3EB`). HTML
theme-colour metadata follows light (`#315C48`) and dark (`#151816`) OS preferences.
If a future explicit in-app theme setting is added, synchronize browser metadata
with that setting too. Existing service-worker registration and update behavior remain.

## Colour guard and validation

From `frontend/`, run `npm run check:colors`. It recursively reports raw hex,
numeric RGB and HSL colours in CSS, TypeScript, JavaScript and SVG source. It is
advisory and is not wired into CI. Investigate each report; do not extend an
allowlist merely to silence an accidental UI colour. The check is textual and
can flag hex-like IDs/comments; review those in context.

Intentional exceptions: `styles/tokens.css` owns palettes; unused original
`assets/react.svg` and `assets/vite.svg` are template artwork. Raster/game artwork,
external image/data colours, metadata in HTML/Vite config and unchanged public
branding artwork are not UI colour declarations and are outside this source guard.

Run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run check:pwa`,
`npm run check:colors`, and `git diff --check`. Inspect both themes for text,
buttons, selected filters, navigation, cards, forms, disabled/error states and
modal overlays. CSS/build checks do not prove authenticated or deployed behavior.
